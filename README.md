### homeworlds

Working on a live multiplayer [binary homeworlds](https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds). Also using this as an excuse to experiment on a minimal firebase-like state synchronization lib. See [src/SharedState.js](src/SharedState.js).

### websocket server

You need node.js installed on your computer.

```
npm install
node server.js
```

### static file server

Anything will do. I use this one for development:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000
